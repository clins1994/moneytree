# Moneytree

View and manage your financial data from [Moneytree](https://getmoneytree.com/jp/home) directly from Raycast. This extension provides quick access to your financial credentials, accounts, balances and latest transactions without leaving your workflow.

If you're concerned about security, please read the [Regarding Security](#regarding-security) section at the end of this document.

## Authentication

Currently, authenticating with Moneytree requires a few manual steps due to the lack of an official Raycast integration on the Moneytree side. You'll need to copy an authorization URL, visit it in a private browser window, and manually extract and paste the authorization code back into the extension. These steps are needed as we can't provide a seamless in-app OAuth experience without Moneytree officially supporting this extension as a client.

We hope that in the future Moneytree will provide an official OAuth client for Raycast, enabling direct authorization with proper browser redirects and a much simpler setup process. But no promises here ...
